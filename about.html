        <p>Team GB Cobras was founded and formed by the 6 Vang brothers in 2017 (Hue,Long,Sen,Soua,Yeng,Lue,Zang). 
            They have since then grown to a team of over 20 people. The GB Cobras were one of the first Hmong cornhole 
            teams to bring cornhole to life for the Hmong community in Green Bay, Wisconsin. The GB Cobras have gone on
             to claim many victories in tournaments throughout the midwest and continue to grow in strength as the years go by.
              This team has a reputation that is known throughout the Hmong Cornhole Community as one of the finest and best in the
               Green Bay, Wisconsin area.</p>
